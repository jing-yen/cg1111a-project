# cg1111a-project
Our group's mBot code for CG1111A lab assignment.

work in progress, adding descriptions.

For our CG1111A project, our mBot had to traverse a maze. But it is not so simple. At every junction/turn (known as a Waypoint Challenge), the mBot had to sense a black line and stop, then take colour readings of the ground (using our homegrown colour sensor) to determine which path to go next.

Aside from constructing our own colour sensor circuit using LEDs and an LDR, we also constructed an IR proximity sensor to help with the provided ultrasonic sensor. Calibrating the two homegrown sensors was not easy at all. 

Overall, I would say the CG1111A project is more challenging than the EG1311 project.
